# RomCom: Paired Project

## Project Overview

This was our first paired project as part of the Turing Frontend Program.
Our goal was to create an app that generates romance novel covers, with the following functionality:

  * generate main page with randomly selected cover on page load
  * generate a random cover using existing and updatable arrays of images, titles, and descriptors
  * create functionality to switch between page views
  * generate a custom cover using form input fields
  * save either a random or custom cover without duplicates
  * display the selection of saved covers in the saved covers section
  * delete unwanted saved covers with a double click

## Instructions

The website can be viewed [here](https://nhodnett.github.io/romcom/).

### Iteration 0: Main Page
  The website will generate a random cover on page load (and also on each page refresh).
### Iteration 1: Show Random Cover
  If the user wants to generate a random cover they can click the "Show New Random Cover" button.
### Iteration 2: Switching Views
  The user can switch between "View Saved Covers", "Make Your Own Cover", and "Show New Random Cover" by clicking the appropriate buttons at the top of the page.
### Iteration 3: Creating a New Cover
  The user can make their own cover with custom image, title, and descriptors. To do this, the user will:
  1. Click "Make Your Own Cover"
  2. Provide an image address, a title, and two descriptors into the respective input fields
  3. Click "Make my book"

### Iteration 4: Saving and Viewing Covers
  The user can save either a randomly generated or custom cover by clicking the "Save Cover" button. This will save the cover currently displayed and allow them to see their saved selection later by clicking the "View Saved Covers" button.

### Iteration 5: Deleting Saved Covers
  The user can delete a saved cover they no longer want to be saved by double clicking the respective cover on the "View Saved Covers" page.

## Future Features
  * Implement data validation and error handling
  * Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
